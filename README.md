This Python face recognition system uses OpenCV and the face_recognition module to recognize faces in real-time through a camera stream. Initializing the model with a custom class called SimpleFacerec, the system imports and encodes face photos, detects frames, matches observed faces against known encoded faces, and identifies detected faces using bounding boxes and relevant names.
